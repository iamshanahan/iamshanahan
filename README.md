Welcome to my github!

I created this github for a few reasons. First, it answers the  question "Do you even code?". Second, it provides evidence of the time I've spent exploring different technologies, like languages, libraries, and special subjects. Lastly, it gives my a safe place to put code for projects I am developing.

As you look around, keep in mind a few things.
- Everything is a work in progress. I don't expect most of these projects to be show-case ready, I just want them to demonstrate my thinking. These are not projects with deadlines. The "FunWith" projects are essentially unbounded. I work on them as long as they interest me.
- There are places where I want to showcase specific abilities or achievements. The "FunWith" projects demonstrate commitment to TDD. R and Clojure exhibit interest in functional thinking. The code in the Questions repository demonstrates adherence to standards.

An interesting way to learn a new thing is to write unit tests against it. So when I encounter descriptive, tutorial-type language describing a technology, I try to turn those statements into unit tests. This forces me to think about the edge cases and exceptions and that, for me, really internalizes the understanding. In addition, these unit tests serve as study notes to review!

So as I explore a technology, I create a repository called "FunWith" (that technology).
